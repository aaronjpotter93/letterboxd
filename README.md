#### Features unique to my app
* Movie <i>&</i> TV Tracking
* Follow Cast & Crew
* Feed (explained more in <i>Better Anticipated</i>)
* Better Social & Dialog (explained more in <i>Better Lists & in Better Social</i>)
* Better Anticipated Movies & TV
  * Projects in speculative, pre, post, release, ect. production stage: timeline and events from notable or followed only cast & crew
  * Feed Media: edits, clips, trailers, marketing highlights featuring followed cast & crew (this idea comes from the fact that tiktok edits have heavily swayed my interest gauge in projects I either had already known about but didn't feel interested in to projects I never heard of)
  * Interest gauge: high interest gets all the project updates while mid-low gets just release date
  * Shared interest at shared gauge featured: when megan and I (or any friends) have overlapping anticipated projects
  * Episode release schedule for all "watching" shows
  * Calendar for tracking anticipated events by tag (examples: release date, began post-production, finished casting)
  * Happening this month, this week or weekend, today (from popular or only from your follows)
* Better where to watch
  * Include all streaming platforms toggle when viewing a movie or tv's show details
  * Panels: (think of streaming apps that have continue watching, new, top 10)
  * panels will rotate on the homepage with higher activity in that panel being featured higher
  * pin (or fix) panel appearance ranking
  * Limbo Panel: for when movies leave the theater and aren't released for purchase, rent, or stream that sucks
  * Digital Birth Panel: new (within a year of release) to rent only availability for all watchlisted projects
* Better Lists
  * Better Watchlist: filter by shared interest (include any number of specified friends to find movies that overlap) and order by interest gauge
  * Watchlist shared interest overlap notifications or featured events (toggleable) get notified when a movie becomes available or is releasing soon (say you have some friends or family who have high interest in something, even if you have mid-low, you'd likely want to be considered if they want to plan something to see it, or if they want to talk about it)
  * Lists can be added to the sidebar (think pinned folders in finder/windows explorer)
  * Backlog List: (are specifically watchlisted movies that have been out on rent or stream for longer then a year)
  * Lost Interest? List: movies with a low gauge interest that have been backlogged for over a year. a mechanic that can be leveraged to easily prune watchlist)
* Better Social & Dialog
  * Because the media Feed is better. 
  * Because Anticipated is better (where shared overlaps)
  * Because Where to watch is better (when something becomes available that others have high interest in and access to)


# Extend to More Interests
Better Logging, Better Tracking, Better Utility, Better Social.

<i>includes all the same features as for movies and tv</i>
> Books: Better Goodreads (Better because it makes use of open library so people can also access material)

> Music: Better Spotify (The Social aspect is ass, and so is the management system (not dynamic enough to represent a persons relationship with their music and feelings and energy, finding the right sound for the mood, discovering music)

> Games: Better GG
