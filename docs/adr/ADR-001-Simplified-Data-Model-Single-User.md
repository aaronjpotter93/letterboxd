## Library Dependencies

We have decided to use the following libraries to simplify development:

1. **opencsv (version 5.10)**

    - **Purpose**: To simplify reading and writing CSV files exported from Letterboxd.
    - **Rationale**: Reduces the need to write custom CSV parsing code, allowing us to focus on core application logic.

2. **themoviedbapi (version 2.3.0)**

    - **Purpose**: To interact with The Movie Database (TMDb) API easily.
    - **Rationale**: Provides a pre-built API client that handles the complexities of HTTP requests and responses, authentication, and API rate limiting.

## Impact on Design

- **Simplified Service Layer**: Using these libraries allows us to write cleaner, more maintainable code in our service classes.
- **Reduced Codebase Size**: Less custom code means fewer places for bugs to hide and less code to maintain.
- **Dependency Management**: We need to manage these dependencies carefully to ensure compatibility and avoid version conflicts.

## Consequences

- **Positive**:
    - Accelerated development due to reusable code.
    - Leverage community-tested libraries for robust functionality.

- **Negative**:
    - Reliance on third-party libraries, which may introduce breaking changes in future updates.
    - Potential for increased application size due to additional library code.

## Future Considerations

- **Monitoring Library Updates**: Keep track of updates to these libraries to maintain compatibility and security.
- **Fallback Plans**: Be prepared to write custom implementations if these libraries become unsupported or fail to meet future requirements.
