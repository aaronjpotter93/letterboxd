“The past is just a story we tell ourselves.”

I had been holding onto this one for a long time but in recent years I’ve been starting to finally let go of the way I used to see myself—stories of my failures on repeat—and have found a new sense of self worth.

<i>“I have a lot of dreams about my ex-wife, Catherine, where were friends like we used to be. And we’re not gonna be together and we’re not together, but we’re friends still.”</i>

I’ve had dreams like this about old friends who helped me become who I am now and have since drifted away from me.

“Myself. My self. That’s the problem. That’s the whole problem with the whole thing. That word, “self.” Thats not the word. That’s not right, that isn’t…How did I forget that? When did I forget that? The body stops a cell at a time, but the brain keeps firing those neurons. Little lightning bolts, like fireworks inside and I thought I’d despair or feel afraid, but I don’t feel any of that. None of it. Because I’m too busy. I’m too busy in the moment. Remembering. Of course. I remember that every atom in my body was forged in a star. This matter, this body is mostly empty space after all, and solid matter. It’s just energy vibrating very slowly while there is no me. There never was. The electrons of my body mingle and dance with the electrons of the ground below me and the air I’m no longer breathing. And I remember there is no point where any of that ends and I begin. I remember I am energy. Not memory. Not self. My name, my personality, my choices, all came after me. I was before them and I will be after, and everything else is pictures, picked up along the way. Fleeting little dreamlets printed on the tissue of my dying brain. And I am the lightning that jumps between. I am the energy firing the neurons, and I’m returning. Just by remembering, I’m returning home. And it’s like a drop of water falling back into the ocean, of which it’s always been a part. All things… a part. You, me and my little girl, and my mother and my father, everyone who’s ever been, every plant, every animal, every atom, every start, every galaxy, all of it. More galaxies in the universe than grains of sand on the beach. And that’s what we’re talking about when we say “God.” The cosmos and its infinite dreams. We are the cosmos dreaming of itself. It’s simply a dream that I think is my life, every time. But I’ll forget this. I always do. I always forget my dreams. But now, in this split-second, in the moment I remember, the instant I remember, I comprehend everything at once. There is no time. There is no death. Life is a dream. It’s a wish. Made again and again and again and again and again and again and on into eternity. And I am all of it. I am everything. I am all. I am that I am.”",,2022-11-24

I watched this subbed and I wish that I didn’t misinterpret Suzume’s motives as romantic. I think that was lost in the translation or culture gap. Will have to watch it again to see if I can understand what drove her to drop everything and risk her life for someone she just met. 

Also confused about the cat’s motives. So Dajin cursed Souta to be the new keystone but then took it back in the end. I get that the cat/god wasn’t opening the doors after all but was just showing them which ones were open but I’m confused at the function of a keystone. Most doors don’t have one. It’s this one family’s job to hold back the evil that would otherwise ravage Japan? But they have to give their soul up for eternity or whatever in ice to hold it back? But the gods can do it too? And they sometimes do and sometimes don’t? Dajin seemed pretty ok with Tokyo getting absolutely shmonked instead of magically keystoning it away.

I don’t even care what happens for the rest of the show.

The writing from Dave and the acting in Hayden’s performance captured the essence of a character so well-loved for both good and evil. The tragedy of the evil he has done, present in his nature where both cruelty and ruthlessness exist alongside kindness and hope in Ahsoka.

It was also emotional just getting to see him dueling and at the pace and ferocity you’d expect from him. 🤺","solo, 💖, 😩, 😭, bestofstarwars",2023-09-14

“What do you think?”

The youth’s reckless ambition to be like their heroes. Even though Jessie entirely accepted the risks to her own life in the end, hungry to not lose her chance, picked the wrong moment. And her mentor steps in front of the bullet. With adrenaline driving Jesse forward she took the picture of Lee dying. Her pacing was inexperienced, highlighted by the interaction with the dress. Too early. Too late. “That was not the moment. There’s a sweet spot.”

2024-08-07,Trap,2024,https://boxd.it/72O6ip,5,,"Surprised this isn’t as well received by the majority. This movie did everything for me. Maybe I’m simple but this very much hit my emotions. 

A serial killer as a protagonist? How am I supposed to feel about him succeeding or even like him? (It helps that Josh Hartnett's hot hot crispy hot) Well the person we become familiar with is a loving dad, someone that the nervous system would signal is safe and for me, that worked—seeing him invested in his daughter and take joy in watching her grow and find confidence (even if it was by his attempts to escape). 

Seeing him later portray a cold and calculated killer was plenty of a rug pull (I knew it was coming so it was more of an emotional rug). The pop star, and the wife making their plays so intelligently was what carried the final act further than I am conditioned by Hollywood to expect (breaking that dumb scary movie trope of fear leading people to do the very wrong thing that leads to their death)

And the last thing that really sent it home for me was the contrast between the profiler’s final lines with that of the pop star’s attempt to lean into his mom’s power over him. Where the first attempt failed to connect —“you are not a monster”—was in who he thinks he is. He believes he’s a monster. We cannot bear the pain of being bare and seen and rejected and in his case people were terrified and disgusted with who he is, striped down (literally shirtless hubba hubba), enter the hallucination of his mom telling him that she sees he's a monster and accepts him as that—all that anyone desperately wants is to be accepted when we are seen for what we believe we really are",,2024-08-06
